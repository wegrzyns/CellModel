## Welcome to the CellModel project page

We are a group of students who attend the "Modeling and the Simulation of Systems" classes on the AGH University of Science and Technology. 

Our team is involved in a project related with the simulation of the Prokaryotic cell.  This page helps us and people interested in this topic to organize acquired knowledge in the researched domain. 
All the descriptions, of the arising application should be available here both with explanations and images.
